1.1 The Stable Matching Problem
===============================

Goal: given M Men and W women.  Each man ranks all women and every woman ranks all men.  We want to order the men and women into pairs such that:
	1. every man and woman appears in exactly 1 pair
	2. there is no pair of pairs (m, w) and (m', w') such that m prefers w' to w and w' prefers m to m'.  In that case it would be better to form the pair (m, w')

Definitions:  /\/\ = { m_1, ... , m_M } set of men
			  \/\/ = { w_1, ... , w_W } set of women

			  then /\/\ x \/\/ = { (w, m), w in \/\/, m in /\/\ } set of all ordered pairs of man and women form /\/\ and \/\/.

			  A maching J is a subset of \/\/x/\/\, and that every man m in /\/\ and every woman in \/\/ appear in at most one pair ( some may be unpaired ).

			  A perfect matching J' is a subset of \/\/x/\/\ such that each w in \/\/ appears in exactly one pair.

A pair (w',m) in \/\/x/\/\ is called an instability w.r.t a matching J if (w',m) is not in J but (w,m) and (w',m') are in J and yet m and w' prefer each other to their assigned partners.

A matching S is stable if (a) it is perfect and (b) there is no instability w.r.t S.

Goal: Given sets \/\/ and /\/\, find a stable matching.


// ma algorithm: give every woman her first pick
	// if two women have the same first pick, resolve by picking woman man prefers for that pair and give remainin woman her 2nd pick (and so on)
	// if there is ever a situation where womanA wants a man as her ith pick and womanB wants the same man as her jth pick give to woman with higher preference, resolve tie with mans preference.

her / Gale-Shapley Algorithm
	let all m in /\/\ and w in \/\/ be free / unpaired
	while there is a free woman that isn't paired to any man yet {

		w takes the highest ranking man that isn't proprosed to yet (m) and checks state {
			if ( he's already engaged ) { 
				she just proposes
			} else { 
				if ( he prefers her m over his m' ) {
					pair (m,w)
					and put w' free
				}
		} 
	}

	pree sure its the same :>>

In the problem there is symmetry w.r.t the men and women but our choice of algorithm introduces an asymmetry w.r.t the men and women.

When a man changes pairs his pairing inproves for him.  Whereas for a woman it gets worse each time.



Defining Patterns of an Algorithm
	in a finite list of instructions
	each instruction can be described properly (?)
	arbitrarily form an initial state and initial input, the instructions describe a completion of a finite number of successive states eventually producing an output and terminating in a finish state.
	each state only depends on the inputs and results of previous states
	output is reached after a finite number of steps (no infinite loops)
